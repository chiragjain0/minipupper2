# What is dt-blob-cam1.dts?
The dt-blob-cam1.dts file is a Device Tree Source file that defines the hardware configuration of a Raspberry Pi compute module. The Camera Serial Interface (CSI) is a dedicated interface in Raspberry Pi for connecting the Raspberry Pi camera module to the Raspberry Pi board. The CSI camera is connected to the camera interface via a ribbon cable, providing a high-speed data connection between the camera and the processor. The dt-blob-cam1.dts file configures the GPIO pins for the CSI camera interface and enables the interface.

The dt-blob-cam1.dts file provides the necessary hardware configuration for the CSI camera interface, including the configuration of the GPIO pins used for the interface. Without this configuration, the Raspberry Pi board will not be able to communicate with the camera module via the CSI interface.

In summary, the dt-blob-cam1.dts file is essential for enabling the CSI camera interface on the Raspberry Pi compute module. Without it, the camera module would not function correctly.
